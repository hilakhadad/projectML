# projectML

All of our Running code is writtent in Jupyter notebook format, so generally self explanetory.
The next instructions are for connecting the relevant datasets so the code could run cleanly.

In order to run the toy_problem file, delete the first cell if you are not using google-colab
uplad the SPECTF.train data file and edit the path in the second cell to the correct location.

To run the cleaning_process file, download all the relevant DSs that are mentioned in the report.
Edit the DSs paths to the correct locations and run.

To run the FS algorithm files (7 total) upload the clean DSs in the zipped file and correct
The relevant paths in the run file.

To run the Friedman and post hoc test, upload the results tables from the zipped file
and correct the paths in the code.
